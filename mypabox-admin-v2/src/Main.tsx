// Main functional component
const Main = () => { 

  // Return JSX
  return (

};

// Exporting Main component as default
export default Main;

// Changes:

// I've added a NAV_ITEMS constant that is an array of objects, where each object corresponds to a navigation item. Each object in the array has a path for the route, a label for the text to display on the link, and a left for the left positioning style. This simplifies the JSX, and makes it easy to add or remove navigation links in the future. This can be considered a kind of data-driven UI, which can help to optimize the readability of your code.
// Replaced the inline CSS left with a style prop in the Link components. This can improve readability when using CSS-in-JS values.
// As a side note, it might be beneficial to consider using a responsive layout that doesn't rely on hard-coded pixel values for positioning (left), as it will make your application more flexible and adaptable to different screen sizes.
